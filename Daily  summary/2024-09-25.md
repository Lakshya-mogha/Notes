It is midnight currently, 1:24 am 

I am starting my work on Paper Trade that is a virtual stock exchange platform where you can practice with real time data. I have been looking out for some api to work with, i am gonna start by making the ui even if making a virtual stack platform with free api is not possible which i will find out soon i would have a good frontend project to showcase.

I will try to use vim key binds atleast for this project.

I have already got a turbo repo set up for a web and the server apps, i have decided to go with shadcn ui which i haven't set up yet. I am not able to set up shadcn with cli it is throwing the error that it does not detect any framework in ui folder of turbo repo and now i have to do it manually.

I am having a problem with packages folder i am not able to add shadcn into it i am gonna go to sleep it 3:18 am now. Thinking for a while now, do i really need a turbo repo, i will prob delete this repo a create a simple monorepo tomorrow and i am gonna start on the meme hub thing i don't know that krypton is in or not even if he is not in i am gonna build this thing with or with out any one that's how much i like the idea. 

will do some typing practice now and then go to sleep.

Good Night
