I’m excited to introduce ViralMemeHub, a platform that connects businesses with mid-tier meme influencers (10 K - 50 K followers) to create viral, culturally relevant marketing campaigns. Our mission is to provide brands with authentic, audience-driven content while offering meme creators a structured way to monetise their creative influence. The problem is twofold: Brands struggle to engage younger audiences with authentic content, and meme creators with niche followings don’t have a reliable way to monetise their influence. ViralMemeHub solves this by building a marketplace where brands and meme creators collaborate to produce high-engagement campaigns. Here’s how it works: We onboard meme page owners with 10 K - 50 K followers into an exclusive community, categorising them by engagement tiers like Bronze, Silver, and Gold. Creators retain creative freedom, ensuring their content remains authentic to meme culture, while we guarantee them reliable payouts for participating in campaigns. Creators can also earn performance-based bonuses for high engagement, and top performers are rewarded with additional cash and access to higher-tier campaigns. We also offer a referral program, letting creators expand the platform and earn additional income. Brands submit their campaign briefs, and our AI matching system pairs them with the most relevant creators based on niche, audience, and engagement. Brands can choose between working with a single creator or launching a “Meme Blitz,” where multiple creators post variations of the same campaign, maximising viral potential. For meme creation, we provide an in-app editor with customizable templates and brand assets. Creators can submit their memes for approval, ensuring brand alignment without stifling creativity. Both creators and brands can track engagement metrics like likes, shares, and comments in real time, and brands receive detailed reports on campaign performance and ROI.

 Our monetisation strategy includes a commission on each campaign (15-20%), premium subscription plans for brands offering advanced analytics and priority access to creators, and premium creator tools like advanced templates and engagement insights. We plan to scale by expanding to platforms like TikTok and X, launching viral challenges, and partnering with larger influencers as ambassadors. Additionally, we will continuously optimise our AI system to ensure more precise targeting and better campaign success. We are seeking pre-seed funding to build our MVP, launch the platform, and onboard both meme creators and brands. ViralMemeHub is positioned to capitalise on the underutilised meme marketing space and turn memes into a reliable, scalable marketing tool for brands and a lucrative income stream for creators.
