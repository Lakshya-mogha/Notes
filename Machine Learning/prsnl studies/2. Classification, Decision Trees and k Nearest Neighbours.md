## Decision tree

The decision tree as a machine learning algorithm is essentially the same thing as the diagram shown above; we incorporate a stream of logical rules of the form “feature ($a$) value is less than ($x$) and feature ($b$) value is less than ($y$) … => Category 1” into a tree-like data structure. The advantage of this algorithm is that they are easily interpretable. 

For example, using the above scheme, the bank can explain to the client why they were denied for a loan: e.g the client does not own a house and her income is less than 5,000.

As we’ll see later, many other models, although more accurate, do not have this property and can be regarded as more of a “black box” approach, where it is harder to interpret how the input data was transformed into the output. Due to this “understandability” and similarity to human decision-making (you can easily explain your model to your boss).
