## 1. Frame the problem

Decide what kind of model is used, how will you get the data, will it run offline or you will use batch learning, what is your target audience. Decide how you will make the model.

## 2. Gathering data

- CSV data 
- API 
- Web scraping
- Database
	- Data warehouse (ETL)
- Spark cluster

## 3. Data preprocessing

Clean the data, make it suitable for model.

- Remove duplicate
- Remove missing values
- Remove outliers
- scale / standardise

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualise the data
- Plot graphs
- Univariant analysis (Analyse individual columns) / Bivariant analysis (Two or columns )
- Outlier detection
- Balance the data set

## 5. Feature Engineering and Selection

Differentiating useful columns and separating them from the rest of data 

( it is just an overview you should spend more and more time init ).

## 6. Model Training, Evaluation ans Selection

Train and evaluate different type of data and choose which model is the best, then tune the parameters of the model to increase performance.

- Ensomble learning 
	use different type of models and integrate the best one.

## 7. Model Deployment

Create a binary and convert it to API. 

## 8. Testing

Ship to a specific group of people and take feedback. 

## 9. Optimize

- If negative feedback leave programming and die.
- Backup model
- Backup data
- Load balancing 
- Retrain model
