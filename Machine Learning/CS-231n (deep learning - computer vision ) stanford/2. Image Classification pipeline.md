# The problem ?? 
**Semantic Gaps

All images are 3D array of numbers \[0,255].

There can be many challenges in classifying an image brightness, occlusion, different angles which change the pixels and an algorithm should be robust of that.

# K-Nearest Neighbour 

It groups data on the basis of how much volume or number they have at a area on a graph.

For more info [[Module 8 - kNN & Classification Performance Metrics]] or [[2. Classification, Decision Trees and k Nearest Neighbours]]

On images it is never used 

1. Terrible performance during test time 
2. Distance metric on level of whole image can be very unintuitive 

# Linear classification 

**Parametric approach**
$f(x,w)$ $where$ $x-Image,w-parameters$
creating a score for each image.

In this approach define a func that goes from x numbers to numbers between y and z (y-z are labels of data).

It is always a matrix multiplication $f(x,w) = 10*3072 +b$ <- $bias, more parameters$

here we have 10 classes so the be will be $10*1$ matrix.

### What does Linear classification do in plain english ??
