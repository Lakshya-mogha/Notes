A data structure. 

# done

 multi dimensional dimensional container for storing numbers or multi dimensional array .

## Scalar

0 d array .

## 1 D tensor/ vector 

[1,2,3,4] 1 D arrays are knows as 4 D vector or 1 D tensors.

The amount of numbers in array is dimension of vector.

## 2 D tensor / matrices

2 D arrays or matrices

## ND tensors

collection of matrices

> [!NOTE] There can be infinite no of dimensions but in machine learning we generally use form 0 D to 5 D

## Rank, Axes and Shape

no. of axis = Rank = no of dimensions

Shape is the no of elements that can be stored in row X column .
