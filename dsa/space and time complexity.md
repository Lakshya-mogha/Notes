- **Time complexity**
    
    Rate at which time taken increases with respect to input size

Time complexity is computed in big - Oh notation - $O(Time Taken)$

Rules for time complexity / Points to remember when computing big 0 .

1. Always compute time complexity for worst case scenario.
2. Avoid constants.
3. Avoid lower value.

Here 8 is constant and it will have no significance.

- **Space complexity**
    
    Auxiliary space (Space that you take to solve a problem ) + input space ( Space that you take to store the input)
