```typescript
// Given two crystal balls that will break if dropped from high enough
// distance, determine the exact spot in which it will break in the most
// optimized way.
```

### Lets discuss our options

(whiteboard)

- Linear
- Binary

### Umm...? what?

You told me...

### Lets implement it!

``` ts
function Two_crystal_balls(breaks: boolean[]):number{
	const jump_amount = Math.floor(math.sqrt(breaks.length));
	let i = jump_amount;
	for ( i < breaks.lenght; i += jump_amount){
		if(breaks[i]){
			break;
		}
	}
	i -= jump_amount;
	for(let j = 0; j <= jump_amount && i < breaks.length; ++j, ++i){
		if (breaks[i]){
			return i;
		}
	}
	return -1;
}
```

### Fun side note

- I have had this exact problem asked more than once as an interview question.
- I have had to implement binary search over a google call in google docs more than once.
