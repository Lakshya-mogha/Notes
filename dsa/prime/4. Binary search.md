## Your second Algorithm

### A L G O R I T H M _ T I M E

This second algorithm is a bit of a doosy, but its definitely a basis for other algorithms we will encounter.

### Is it ordered?

Lets say it is this time. So how can we search this array?

it cannot be implemented on an unsorted array.

### First, lets come up with our own algorithm together

to search a value in a array create two halves of the array look for value, if the value id in the smaller half half it again until a value if found.

### Another Big O trick

If the input halves at each step, its likely O(LogN) or O(NlogN)

### This is Binary Search

One of the greatest algos ever!

### Lets implement it
``` ts
function binary_search(arr: number[], number:number ):boolean{
	let lo = 0;
	let hi = arr.length;

	do{
		const m = math.floor(lo + (hi - lo )/2);
		const v = arr[m];
		if(v === number) { 
			return true; 
		}else if (v > needle){
			hi = m;
		} else {
			lo = m - 1;
		}
	} while (lo < hi);
	return false ; 
}
```

- dont forget to divide by 2
