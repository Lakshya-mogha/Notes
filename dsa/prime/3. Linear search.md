## Algorithms

The A in DSA

### When applicable

I will pretend that javascript actually has arrays.

- I only have access to the `.length` property of an array.
- no i wont go full c neckbeard and require length to be passed in.

Its a very good practice to get into is being able to visualize the problem, discuss it with boxes and arrows, and then program it. Its definitely a core competency that will follow you for life.

### Our first search!

### Possibly the simpliest algo, Linear Search

As I said, lets whiteboard this.

### Important concepts

1. growth is with respect to the input
2. Constants are dropped
3. Worst case is _usually_ the way we measure

### Lets implement it

``` ts
function linear_search(arr: number[], number: number ): boolean {
	for (int i = 0 ; i<arr.length ; i++ ){
		if(arr[i] === number){
			return true;
		}
	}
	return false;
} 
```
