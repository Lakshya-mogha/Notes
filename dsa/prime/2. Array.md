Yes. Array. I know you are all thinking... "but i know this."

### Well... you also said const a = []

hurts. sorry.

### if const a = [] isn't an array, what is it?

Well by the end of this section we can empirically tell what it is.

### So lets talk about arrays. (white board time)

Covering: Lets practice our BigO!!!

- What are arrays
- Getting at specific index
- Insertion at specific index
- Deletion at specific index

All operation in arrays are in constant time O(1).

### Arrays

They are fixed size, continiguous memory chunks

a[0] =  starting address of an array + 0 * the byte size(int32 = 32 bytes)

a[2] =  starting address of an array + 2 * the byte size(int32 = 32 bytes)

- That means you cannot grow it
- There is no "insertAt" or push or pop. Doesn't mean you can't write those though
